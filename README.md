### A Hyper Island student project
This is the source code for the digital version of a small game I built with my team, during the first weeks at Hyper Island.

# Project

Outside the box is a game that provides you with different tasks to encourage your creativity. The box contains 52 different cards with various creative tasks. To achieve maximum creativity, we recommend that you take at least one card each day.

You can play on your own or together with others. This game is recommended for anyone who wants to be even more awesome.
